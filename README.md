Your Daily Spender uses the YNAB API to keep track of how much money users are spending each day and a running total against their daily limit goal.

If money spent on a given day is less than the daily limit, the remaining balance will rollover to the next day.

2. After authorizing your YNAB credentials, you be prompted to answer how much money you aim to spend a day

3. Next you'll be asked to supply a start date, from which you want to start tracking

4. Finally, you want to choose what categories you want to factor in your daily spending amounts
